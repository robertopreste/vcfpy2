Python 3 VCF library, based on vcfpy_.

This module is only intended to be used by HmtNote_; it is an exact clone of the vcfpy_ module, where a couple of lines of code were changed to better suit my needs.

I found an issue_ in the original vcfpy module and made a related `pull request`_ to fix it. However, it takes some time to accept my changes, while I need them implemented right now for my software to work properly, so I built this parallel module with the edits I need.

As soon as the issue gets fixed in the original module, I will delete this one.
